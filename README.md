# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
The Pyber Analysis focuses on the relatationship between the type of city, number of drivers and riders, and the percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city. Using matplotlib, pandas library, and python a visualization was produced to to show fare prices by city type.
## Results
![summary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damansandhu/PyBer_Analysis/main/PyBer_fare_summary.png)
* Rural cities has the least amount of drivers, rides and total fares.
* Urban cities have the most amount of drivers, rides and total fares.
* Suburban cities are in the middle having the 2nd most drivers, rides and total fares.
* Although Rural cities see the least amount of drivers,rides & fares the have the highest average of fare per ride and fare per driver.
* Although the Urban cities command the most drivers, rides and fares they have the lowest average of fare per ride and fare per driver.
## Summary
While we did not explore every city, we can put together an idea of what fares will be on a weekly bases based on the city type. Putting the cities into different categories will allow us to charge passengers rates accordingly. Rural areas require a higher fare due to less overall workers, travel time, and the distance is usually longer making the average fare per ride and river the greatest out of the three city types.
### Recommendations
When making recommendations to the CEO, I would recommend that drivers are assigned to different city types based off of the type of city they usually work in making it easier for a rural driver to know the route and city driver to know the city streets and or shortcuts. Also, urban cities should require a higher charge per mile due to the duration of the trips being shorter making up for the cost to the drivers. And lastly, have small charge increases and decreases based off how many riders there are during certain months of the year.
